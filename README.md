# TMHINT-QI VoiceMOS2023

This repository aims to publically share the training and test data of TMHINT-QI version II, which was used as one of the tracks in VoiceMOS Challenge 2023. 

## TMHINT-QI version II 
The TMHINT-QI version II  is the updated version of the original <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TMDiz6dnS76hxyeAcCQxeSqqEOH4UDN0/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">TMHINT-QI</a> dataset. The version I dataset has no unseen scenarios for the evaluation set. Therefore, the version II dataset aims to accommodate such concerns by modifying the training and validation set and providing the unseen systems for the evaluation sets.
